                        This analysis of the Titanic dataset shows that of the passengers who survived the disaster, 136
                        were in first class, 87 were in second class, and 119 were in third class. This means that the
                        proportion of survivors in each class was approximately 15.6% for first class, 9.8% for second
                        class, and 13.3% for third class. This breakdown provides some insight into how the survival
                        rate varied by passenger class, with a higher proportion of first class passengers surviving
                        compared to second and third class passengers. It is worth noting that there may be other
                        factors, in addition to passenger class, that contributed to the differences in survival rates.

                        This analysis of the Titanic dataset shows that among the passengers who did not survive the
                        disaster, 80 were in first class, 97 were in second class, and 372 were in third class. This
                        breakdown provides some insight into the class distribution of the passengers who did not
                        survive, and suggests that the majority of the deceased passengers were in third class. It is
                        worth noting that the class of a passenger on the Titanic was closely related to their
                        socio-economic status and access to resources such as lifeboats, and this may have influenced
                        their likelihood of survival. It may be worth exploring this relationship further in your
                        analysis of the dataset.

                        This analysis of the Titanic dataset shows the number of passengers who survived the disaster,
                        grouped by the deck on which their cabin was located. The results show that there were 7
                        passengers who survived and were assigned to Deck A, 35 passengers who survived and were
                        assigned to Deck B, 35 passengers who survived and were assigned to Deck C, 25 passengers who
                        survived and were assigned to Deck D, 24 passengers who survived and were assigned to Deck E, 8
                        passengers who survived and were assigned to Deck F, and 2 passengers who survived and were
                        assigned to Deck G. This breakdown provides some insight into the relationship between the deck
                        assignment of a passenger and their likelihood of survival. It is possible that passengers who
                        were assigned to higher decks had a greater chance of survival due to their proximity to the
                        lifeboats or other factors.

                        disaster, the largest number were located on Deck C, with a total of 24 deaths. Deck B had the
                        second highest number of deaths, with 12, followed by Deck D and E, which both had 8 deaths.
                        Deck A had the lowest number of deaths, with 8, followed by Deck F and G, which had 5 and 2
                        deaths, respectively. This breakdown provides some insight into the distribution of deaths among
                        the different decks on the Titanic. It is worth noting that the total number of deaths on each
                        deck adds up to the overall number of deaths in the dataset, and that the distribution of deaths
                        among the different decks may be influenced by a variety of factors such as the location of the
                        cabins on the ship, the availability of lifeboats, and the demographics of the passengers who
                        were located on each deck.
